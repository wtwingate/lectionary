  <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Purpose</h2>
  <p class="my-4">
    The primary purpose of this site is to provide a convenient way for
    pastors, worship leaders, and church admins to get accurate information
    about upcoming days in the Anglican lectionary, as found in the
    <a class="underline" href="https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/">Book of Common Prayer 2019</a>.
    In particular, this site provides a number of features that should
    prove useful for those who are responsible for creating bulletins and
    Scripture inserts for their local congregations.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">How to Use</h2>
  <p class="my-4">
    Most of the site should be fairly self-explanatory. By default, the main
    page shows all the upcoming holy days over the next four weeks. If you
    need to look further ahead (or behind) you can set your own start and
    end dates and click the search button.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Clicking on the name of a day will take you to its detail page,
    where the Collect and Lessons for the day are displayed, along with
    other bits of liturgical information. If you're making a bulletin or
    Scripture insert, you can click the big copy button to have all those
    texts automagically copied into your system clipboard. Copy. Paste.
    Prosper.

  <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Psalms</h2>
  <p class="my-4">
    The translation of the Psalter used on this website is the <em>New Coverdale Psalter</em> 
    included in the <em>Book of Common Prayer 2019</em>. This translation is a mild update
    of the historic Anglican Psalter found in the <em>Book of Common Prayer 1662</em>
    aimed at removing extreme archaisms while retaining the traditional poetic quality
    of the original. Occasionally, the versification of the <em>(New) Coverdale Psalter</em>
    doesn't line up with modern Bible translations, but all the words are still there!
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">The Apocrypha</h2>
  <p class="my-4">
    Currently, there is no *official* ESV translation of the Apocrypha, although
    there have been a handful of third-party efforts that seek to fill this gap.
    Unfortunately, none of them are available online, and so the text of those
    lessons is not provided here. If you want to include them in your bulletin,
    you can find the Apocryphal texts on websites like
    <a class="underline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">BibleGateway</a>.
    Just remember that readings from the Apocrypha are properly concluded with
    "Here ends the Lesson," since they are <strong>not</strong> "The Word of the Lord" 😉
